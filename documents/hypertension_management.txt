HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

Blood Pressure Classification:
Normal blood pressure is defined as systolic <120 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg. Elevated blood pressure is systolic 120-129 and diastolic <80. Stage 1 hypertension is systolic 130-139 or diastolic 80-89 mmHg. Stage 2 hypertension is systolic ≥140 or diastolic ≥90 mmHg. Hypertensive crisis is systolic >180 or diastolic >120 requiring immediate medical attention.

First-Line Antihypertensive Agents:
For most patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension, first-line therapy includes thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone 12.5-25mg daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50mg daily. ACE inhibitors like lisinopril 10-40mg daily or enalapril 5-20mg twice daily are preferred for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine 5-10mg daily are effective alternatives, especially for elderly patients or those of African descent. ARBs like losartan 50-100mg daily are suitable alternatives to ACE inhibitors when cough occurs.

Combination Therapy:
If monotherapy fails to achieve blood pressure targets after 4-6 weeks, combination therapy is recommended. Effective combinations include ACE inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor plus thiazide diuretic, or ARB plus calcium channel blocker. Triple therapy adds a third agent from a different class.

Blood Pressure Targets:
For most adults with hypertension, the treatment goal is <130/80 mmHg. For adults aged 65 years or older, a target of <130/80 is reasonable if tolerated. For patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, the target remains <130/80 mmHg.

Resistant Hypertension:
Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite adherence to three antihypertensive agents of different classes at optimal doses, including a diuretic. Spironolactone 25-50mg daily is the preferred fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension.

Hypertensive Emergency Management:
Hypertensive emergencies require immediate blood pressure reduction using intravenous agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or nitroprusside in intensive care settings. Blood pressure should be reduced by no more than 25% in the first hour to avoid organ hypoperfusion.
