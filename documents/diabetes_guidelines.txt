TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS - CLINICAL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

First-Line Treatment:
Metformin is the preferred first-line pharmacological agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The initial dose is typically 500mg once or twice daily with meals, gradually titrated to 1000mg twice daily based on tolerability and glycemic response. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic glucose production. Common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort, which can be minimized by starting with low doses and taking with food.

Diagnostic Criteria:
Diabetes is diagnosed when fasting plasma glucose is ≥126 mg/dL on two separate occasions, or HbA1c ≥6.5%, or random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia. Prediabetes is defined as fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%.

Glycemic Targets:
The general HbA1c target for most adults with type 2 diabetes is <7%. More stringent targets (HbA1c <6.5%) may be appropriate for younger patients with short disease duration and no cardiovascular disease. Less stringent targets (HbA1c <8%) may be considered for patients with limited life expectancy, advanced complications, or extensive comorbidities.

Second-Line Agents:
When metformin monotherapy is insufficient, second-line options include GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and dulaglutide which are particularly beneficial for patients with established cardiovascular disease or those needing weight loss. SGLT2 inhibitors like empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce cardiovascular events and progression of kidney disease. DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin offer neutral effects on weight. Sulfonylureas like glipizide and glyburide are effective but carry risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.

Insulin Therapy:
Basal insulin is indicated when combination therapy fails to achieve glycemic targets. NPH insulin or long-acting analogs such as glargine or detemir are typically started at 10 units daily or 0.1-0.2 units per kg body weight, titrated based on fasting glucose levels.

Lifestyle Modifications:
Medical nutrition therapy and physical activity remain cornerstones of diabetes management. Patients should aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Weight loss of 5-10% can significantly improve glycemic control in overweight individuals.
