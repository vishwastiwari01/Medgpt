ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES

Community-Acquired Pneumonia:
For outpatient management of previously healthy adults with community-acquired pneumonia, amoxicillin 1g three times daily or doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 5-7 days is recommended. For patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disease, or COPD, combination therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125mg twice daily plus azithromycin 500mg on day 1 then 250mg daily for days 2-5 is preferred.

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection:
For acute uncomplicated cystitis in women, nitrofurantoin 100mg twice daily for 5 days or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800mg twice daily for 3 days are first-line options. Fosfomycin 3g as a single dose is an alternative. Fluoroquinolones should be reserved for complicated infections due to side effect profile and resistance concerns.

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis:
Most cases of acute sinusitis are viral and do not require antibiotics. Bacterial sinusitis is suspected when symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen after initial improvement. First-line treatment is amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125mg twice daily for 5-7 days. For penicillin-allergic patients, doxycycline 100mg twice daily or levofloxacin 500mg daily are alternatives.

Streptococcal Pharyngitis:
Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is treated with penicillin V 500mg twice daily or amoxicillin 500mg twice daily for 10 days. For penicillin-allergic patients, azithromycin 500mg on day 1 followed by 250mg daily for days 2-5, or cephalexin 500mg twice daily for 10 days in patients without severe penicillin allergy.

Skin and Soft Tissue Infections:
For simple cellulitis without purulence, cephalexin 500mg four times daily or dicloxacillin 500mg four times daily for 5-10 days is appropriate. If MRSA is suspected based on local prevalence or purulent drainage, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800mg twice daily plus cephalexin, or doxycycline 100mg twice daily, or clindamycin 300-450mg three times daily should be used.

Antibiotic Stewardship Principles:
Antibiotics should only be prescribed when bacterial infection is confirmed or highly suspected. The narrowest spectrum agent effective against the likely pathogen should be selected. Treatment duration should be the shortest effective period. Obtain cultures before initiating therapy when feasible, especially for serious infections.

Penicillin Allergy Assessment:
Most patients reporting penicillin allergy can safely receive penicillins or cephalosporins. True IgE-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, or urticaria occurring within one hour of exposure represent true allergy. Delayed rashes or family history of allergy do not preclude use. Consider allergy testing or graded challenge when appropriate.
